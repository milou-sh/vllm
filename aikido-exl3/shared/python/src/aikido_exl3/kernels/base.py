"""The contract every kernel backend implements.

Backends see MatrixSpec + tensors + caller-owned workspace. They never see a
vLLM layer, never allocate on the run path, and never change weight values.
Selection happens once per (matrix group, rows bucket) at load time; a backend
that cannot serve a key says so with a reason instead of failing at run time.
